Privacy Policy for Pixel
Effective Date: June 19, 2025

Thank you for choosing Pixel ("we," "us," "our"). Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how our application works and how we handle your data.

Our core principle is privacy by design. The Pixel app operates completely offline and is built to function without collecting or transmitting any of your personal information or photos.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

Pixel does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information. This includes, but is not limited to:

Your name, email address, or contact information.
Your photos, videos, or any other media files.
The metadata (including EXIF data) of your files.
Usage analytics, crash reports, or device identifiers.
2. Information the App Accesses Locally

To perform its core function, Pixel requires permission to access your device's storage. The app accesses the following data solely on your device:

Photo Files: The app reads your photo files from the input directory you select in order to move them to the organized output directory.
EXIF Metadata: The app reads the EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data from your photo files. This is used exclusively to determine the date and time a photo was taken, which is necessary for sorting the photos into year and month folders.
All this data is processed locally on your device and is never sent to us or any third party.

3. How We Use Information

The information accessed by Pixel is used for the sole purpose of providing the app's functionality: sorting your photos into a folder structure based on their "Date Taken" information. The entire process is automated and local. Once the sorting is complete, the app does not retain any of this information.

4. Permissions Required

Pixel requires the following permission to function correctly:

Read Media Images / Read External Storage (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): This permission is essential for the app to access the photos you wish to organize from your selected directory. Without this permission, the app cannot perform its sorting function.
5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not share any of your data with any third party. Period. Since the app works offline and does not collect your files or personal information, there is no data to share.

6. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. As all processing occurs locally on your device, your photos and their metadata are not exposed to external servers or network risks through our app. The app operates within the standard security model of the Android operating system.

7. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
